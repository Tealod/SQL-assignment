- A **faculty** can have **many courses**.  
- A **faculty** can have **many students**.  
  → **course** → **faculty** = Many-to-One  
  → **student** → **faculty** = Many-to-One  

###  Course
- Each **course** is linked to one **professor** (1:1).
- Each **course** belongs to one **faculty** (many-to-one).
- Each **course** can have many **enrolments**.

###  Student
